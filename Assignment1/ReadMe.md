I accidently uploaded all of my files instead of just the relevent files for this assignment.

The relevent files are: AnalyseData.cxx, CustomFunctions.cxx, and CustomFunctions.h

To compile the code first ensure you are in the correct directory, all files for this assignment are in the folder 'Assignment1'. Type 'g++ AnalyseData.cxx CustomFunctions.cxx CustomFunctions.h -o AnalyseData' into the terminal to compile the code.

To run the code type './AnalyseData' into the terminal.
